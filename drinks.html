    Summer Moon is known for its special brewed coffee. On the 27th of June, 2002, Summer Moon Coffee started its business in Austin, Texas. They began, simply as a coffee bar, but quickly turned their attention to coffee roasting. In 2004, inspired by the early American coffee roasters and the simplicity of their tools: brick, fire and wood, they set out to craft custom coffee roasts that they are truly proud to call their own.
